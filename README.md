This is the second demo repository.
This is a tutorial on GIT

Steps to setup project:

1. requirements.txt
2. setup.py
3. pip install -r requirements.txt

Steps to create new branch :

1. Check which branches are present:
   git branch

2. Creating new branch 
   git checkout -b name_of_branch

3. commit and push to the new branch
   
   git commit -m "the new commit for the new branch"
   push origin branch_name

4. When pullling from a new branch:
   git pull origin name_of_branch

These were the steps to push and pull from the sub branch.
These changes are initially done in the new branch and the branches are not merged yet.
